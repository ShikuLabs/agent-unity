# IC Agent

## Introduction

The project brings the `IC` ecosystem to `Unity`, allowing Unity developers to call the functions of canisters on IC, create encrypted account files, and access the `Internet Identity`.

But the project is in an early stage, feature-less, documentation-sparse, and API will be changed frequently.

Using the project in the experiment is ok, but not recommended for productive projects.

The project will be stable as soon as possible.
